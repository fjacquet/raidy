# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.6.1] - 2026-05-24

### Changed
- PowerPoint export is now a single executive one-pager instead of a 7-slide deck. The slide keeps all visuals — Sankey capacity waterfall, performance speedometers, and resilience donut — alongside a compact key-metrics grid (usable capacity, efficiency, IOPS, power, energy, CO₂, survival) and a bottleneck footer.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-05-24

### Changed
- Federated developer conventions with the sibling **vatlas** project (reference): Biome config (now identical), TypeScript layout + test type-checking via `tsconfig.test.json`, dependency versions, and the `docs/` structure.
- Upgraded Vite 7→8, `@vitejs/plugin-react` 5→6, i18next 25→26, react-i18next 16→17, jsdom 28→29; removed unused `autoprefixer`/`postcss`.
- Consolidated CI into a single hardened pipeline (`static.yml`): Node 24, SHA-pinned actions, supply-chain denylist, `npm audit` (LOW+), OSV-Scanner gate, bundle-size budgets, and a CycloneDX SBOM. Removed Snyk.
- Restructured documentation under `docs/` (ARCHITECTURE, DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, CONFIGURATION, GETTING-STARTED) with ADRs for the security gate and the intentional divergences from vatlas.

### Fixed
- PowerPoint export: the drive-detail slide now reads the correct nested fields — Active Power (`power.load_watts`) and DWPD (`reliability.dwpd`, shown only for flash). Previously rendered "undefined W" and never emitted the DWPD row.
- Resolved 170 latent type errors across the test suite, which is now type-checked in CI (the previous `typecheck` script was a no-op for app/test code).

### Security
- Bumped `dompurify` to 3.4.5 (resolves a moderate advisory). CI now fails on LOW+ advisories via both `npm audit` and OSV-Scanner, and adds a telemetry-package denylist supply-chain gate.
